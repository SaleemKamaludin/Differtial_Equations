# Differtial_Equations

In here you'll have access to some notes and solutions from the 2017 version and older version of the course.

Not all content done at the time was present in the course outline so I included content from previous years and merged all together.
The hand written notes are still avaiable on **Bitbucket** but are riddled with errors. Use at your own descretion. :smile:
